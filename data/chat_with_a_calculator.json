A semaphore is a signaling device used historically for sending information over distances using visually observable items such as flags, lights, or mechanically movable arms. In computing, a semaphore also refers to a variable or abstract data type used to control access to a common resource by multiple processes and avoid critical section problems in a concurrent system such as a multitasking operating system.\n\nIf you have any calculations or math-related questions, feel free to ask!"
